#### Description:
PlateCapture is a web-based application designed to make license plate recognition simple, accurate, and accessible. Built with cutting-edge technologies like OpenCV and Tesseract OCR, PlateCapture uses your device's camera to detect and read vehicle license plates in real-time. Whether you're managing parking lots, monitoring traffic, or simply exploring the potential of computer vision, PlateCapture provides a user-friendly solution that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.

The application is designed with a clean and modern dark theme, making it easy on the eyes during extended use. When you open PlateCapture, it immediately starts accessing your camera (with your permission) and displays a live video feed. As vehicles pass by, the system automatically detects license plates, draws a bounding box around them, and displays the recognized plate number above the box. The detected plates are then listed in real-time, complete with timestamps, creating a clear and organized record of all recognized vehicles.

One of the standout features of PlateCapture is its focus on accuracy and efficiency. The system uses advanced image processing techniques to enhance the quality of the captured frames, ensuring that even blurry or low-light images are processed effectively. It also includes a validation system to ensure that only properly formatted license plates are recognized, reducing errors and false positives. The user interface is intuitive, with smooth animations that make the experience enjoyable and professional.

PlateCapture is optimized for mobile devices, making it a perfect tool for on-the-go use. The application handles camera permissions efficiently, providing clear instructions if access is denied and offering a button to enable the camera with a single tap. The responsive design ensures that the interface looks great on any screen size, while the lightweight code ensures smooth performance even on older devices.
